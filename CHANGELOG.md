# Octave Hacking for VS Code Change Log

This file is a list of notable changes to the Octave Hacking VS Code extension.

This project attempts to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for its releases. But Andrew (its main developer) isn't good enough at TypeScript or VS Code extension development to guarantee that. Releases may be yanked and reversioned if we mess up bad enough on that front.

This file is roughly in [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0) format.

In this document, "the syntax" refers to the Octave M-code syntax definition inside the extension.
